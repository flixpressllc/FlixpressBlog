# Flixpress Blog

This blog is generated using Pretzel. See the [Pretzel installation guide](https://github.com/Code52/pretzel/wiki/Installing-Pretzel) so you can generate the blog on your computer.

I believe this should technically work with Jekyll as well...

Once the `pretzel` command is available on your machine, you should use the `pretzel taste` command to view locally.

The `pretzel bake` command will build the site for copy-pasting into the `/blog/` folder on Flixpress.com.
