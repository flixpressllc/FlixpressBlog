Text to speech has come a long way in the last several years. With Apple's Siri,
Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google Now, many people have gotten used
to having quick verbal exchanges with their computers and devices. There is a lot
of discussion around the usefulness of such features and the comparative intelligence
of each platform's assistant.

That's all well and good, but one interesting offshoot of this race for the best
conversation-based personal assistant is that many companies have put more investment
into synthesizing the human voice. The difference between Siri's voice when the feature
was first announed and today is pretty astounding. Here at Flixpress, we have
benefitted greatly from these improvements. Here is a taste of what is available
now at Flixpress:

That was one of our templates---one that has been out for a while---showing off
a brand new feature of Flixpress.com: **Text To Speech**.

## What can I do with it?

As always, Flixpress is dedicated to making high-quality, custom video affordable
for everyone. That was the whole guiding principle behind the creation of Flixpress.
Text To Speech brings affordability to two major areas of video production: voiceovers
and internationalization.

### Voiceovers

If you are creating a video that really calls for some kind of narration, but you
can't do it yourself, your only option used to be to hire someone to do it for you.
Of course, there were always some [less-than-great][HAL]
third party TTS options in the past. But even with a good quality voiceover sound,
You would still have to create your video in one place, then create your narration
in another place. Change one, and the other is wrong and vice versa.

But since Flixpress now has a custom engine that works inside our templates, you
can create great sounding voiceovers right inside your Flixpress project. They
will naturally time out correctly, and are much easier to adjust.

### Internationalization

I don't speak a second language but my boss (and CEO of Flixpress) does. I asked
him if he would give me a translation of the video I made above, so I could just
plop in the Russian:

Pretty nice. The best part is that all I needed was the text. I didn't even need
to go find someone who knows Russian. Because [the internet knows Russian][russian].

So now you can create your videos and have the voiceover translated into other
languages. How cool is that?

Text To Speech is slowly being added to many templates at Flixpress. If you'd like
to try it out, choose [the template I've used above][temp31]. It's already available there.
