This file will create a url to the article's featured_image. Be sure that the
page or post you are using actually has one before calling this file.

Images with two slashes (`//`) in the url will not be modified.

Images beginning with a single slash will root themselves in the root directory
of this blog.

Images without a single beginning slash will root themselves in
<blog root>/img/<year of article>/<month of article>/

This file must NOT have any printing spaces or an extra carriage return at the end.

The bit below does its best to determine if we are on a page or on a post. Includes
in Pretzel do not allow variables to be specifically passed in, so we have to guess
what our variable names might be. Pretty hacky... but sustainable for a little while.

{% endcomment %}

{% if post %}
  {% assign article = post %}
{% else %}
  {% assign article = page %}
{% endif %}


{% capture first %}{{ article.featured_image | truncate: 1, '' }}{% endcapture %}

{% if article.featured_image contains '//' %}
  {% comment %} Print the image url without modification {% endcomment %}
  {{ article.featured_image }}
  
{% elsif first == '/' %}
  {% comment %} Print the image url with baseurl {% endcomment %}
  {{ site.baseurl }}{{ article.featured_image }}
  
{% else %}
  {{ site.baseurl }}/img/{{ article.date | date: "%Y/%m/" }}{{ article.featured_image }}
